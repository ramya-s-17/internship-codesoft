            <h2>About Mother Teresa</h2>
            <p>
                Mother Teresa, born as Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, was a Roman Catholic nun and missionary 
                who devoted her life to serving the poorest of the poor. She founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, which grew into a worldwide 
                organization helping the sick, the abandoned, and the dying. Her incredible faith, determination, and love made her a global symbol of hope and compassion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over her lifetime, she established hospices, schools, and shelters, impacting millions of lives. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 
                for her "work in bringing help to suffering humanity." Mother Teresa passed away on September 5, 1997, but her legacy of kindness lives on.

<p>Mother Teresa’s Sacrifices and Faith in God
Mother Teresa’s life was one of extraordinary sacrifice, deeply rooted in her unshakable faith in God. From a young age, she felt a divine calling to leave behind her family, comfort, and personal ambitions to serve humanity’s most marginalized and destitute. She often said, "I have found the paradox, that if you love until it hurts, there can be no more hurt, only more love." Guided by her faith, she embraced a life of simplicity and poverty, dedicating herself entirely to the needs of others.

Her sacrifices were not merely material but deeply personal and spiritual. She gave up the possibility of marriage, wealth, and personal comfort to follow God’s will. In the slums of Kolkata, she worked tirelessly to care for the sick, the dying, and the abandoned, often risking her health and safety. She personally cleaned wounds, fed the hungry, and comforted the dying, seeing each person as a reflection of Christ. Despite the immense challenges she faced, she never faltered in her mission, famously stating, "God doesn’t require us to succeed, only to try."

Mother Teresa’s profound connection with God was the cornerstone of her strength and perseverance. Even during periods of spiritual darkness, when she questioned her faith and felt distant from God, she continued to serve with unwavering determination. She believed her struggles were a way to unite with Christ's suffering, drawing even closer to Him. She would spend hours in prayer and meditation, drawing strength from her belief that every act of love and service was an act of devotion to God.

Her entire life was a living example of Christ’s teachings—sacrificing herself to bring hope and dignity to others. In her humility, she often described herself as "a small pencil in the hand of God," believing that her work was not her own but a divine mission. Mother Teresa’s sacrifices, fortified by her deep spirituality, left an indelible mark on the world, teaching us the power of faith, love, and selflessness.</p>
